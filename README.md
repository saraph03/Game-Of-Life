# Game-Of-Life
Given the structure of Conway's Game of Life, methods were implemented to create the application portion of the game
Given a graph, I mainly determined the cell state (alive/dead), number of alive cells, alive neighbors, generating next generations of communities of cells,
and the number of communities in the graph 
Implemented 2D arrays
